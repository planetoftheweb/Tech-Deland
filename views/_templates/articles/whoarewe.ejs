  <h1>Who are we?</h1>
  <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/TechDeLand/"><img style="float: right; width: 200px;" src="images/logos/meetup_logo.png" alt="Meetup Logo"></a>Tech DeLand is a group of technology enthusiasts in the Downtown DeLand area meeting the fourth Thursday of each month to encourage a better understanding of technology. We do this by sharing what we know about technology with others.</p>

  <p>The group encourages learning in all types of technology including Photography, Graphic Design, Web Design, Web Development and more. We dream of Downtown DeLand one day becoming a place that's well known for a thriving tech scene.</p>
